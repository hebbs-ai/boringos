Add `requiredScopes: ScopeDefinition[]` to `ConnectorDefinition` (closes the `profileService` hidden-service hack in `@boringos/connector-google`). `AuthManager.startOAuthFlow` now merges connector-required identity scopes with caller-requested service scopes (deduped) so any `ConnectorDefinition` can declare always-on OAuth scopes without piggybacking on the services flattener. `googleConnector` switches from `services: [profileService, …]` to `requiredScopes: PROFILE_SCOPES`; the `profileService` export is removed (it had no external consumers). Backward compatible: existing connectors without `requiredScopes` behave identically. Closes the `profileService` API-shape bullet in #61 (MDK Phase 0, T0.1 in `plans/module-dev-kit.md`).
